        <h2 id="introduction">A Bicycle, a Lesson, and Arithmetic Progression</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="content-inner">
        <p>We will begin our discussion with a story.</p>
        <p>Ritesh Kumar approached his father, Mr. Kumar, requesting a bicycle.
          As a mathematician, Mr. Kumar told him he would need to earn it through
          effort. He proposed a daily allowance starting at one rupee, increasing
          by one rupee each day, contingent on completing his homework.
        </p>
        <p>Initially, Ritesh thought this was unfair, realizing it would take
          too long to gather the 1770 rupees needed for the bicycle. However, he
          found a motivational book on his pillow the next morning, which sparked
          his interest in a chapter about "Arithmetic Progression." He soon
          realized that by completing his homework diligently for less than two
          months, he could earn the money, understanding the lesson his father
          intended to teach him.
        </p>
        <p>Now, let us learn that lesson ourselves.</p>

      

        <section id="ap"><h1>Arithmetic Progression</h1>


        <p>An Arithmetic Progression is nothing but a list of numbers (which can
          represent anything), in which each term is obtained by adding a fixed
          number, called the Common Difference, to the previous term(except for the
          first term). To construct an Arithmetic Progression, initiate with the 
          specified first term, increment it by the designated common difference, 
          and continue this procedure iteratively.
        </p>

        <p>Some examples of Arithemetic progression are
          <ol>
            <li><span class="math-inline">\(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,\cdots\)</span>
              <p>First terms is 1 and common difference is 1.</p></li>
            <li><span class="math-inline">\(2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,\cdots\)</span>
              <p>First term is 2 and common difference is 2.</p></li>
            <li><span class="math-inline">\(3,9,15,21,\cdots\)</span>
              <p>First term is 3 and common difference is 6.</p></li>
          </ol>
        </p></section>
        
        
        <p>We are going to analyze how Ritesh solved his problem by formulating
          this progression. For our discussion, we will denote the n-th term of
          the progression as         
          <span class="math-inline">\(a_n\)</span>, 
          the common difference as 
          <span class="math-inline">\(d\)</span>, 
          and the sum of the first n terms of the progression as 
          <span class="math-inline">\(S_n\)</span>. 
          I will now present two important results. 
          

        </p>

        
        <span class="math-inline">
          <div id="eq:enumeration1">
            \[\begin{equation} \tag{1}
              a_n=a_1+(n-1)d,
            \end{equation}\]
          </div>

          <div id="eq:enumeration2">
            \[\begin{equation} \tag{2}
              S_n = \frac{n}{2}\{2a_1 + (n - 1)d\}
            \end{equation}\]

          <div class="tcolorbox-title">Important Note For The Readers</div>
          <div class="tcolorbox-body">
            <p>
              I encourage readers to engage with these formulas personally and to
              attempt to prove them, even if it takes several weeks of dedicated
              effort. The time you invest is undoubtedly worthwhile. The inherent
              beauty of mathematics is that once you begin to appreciate the subject
              truly, it becomes a constant presence in your thoughts. You may find
              yourself contemplating mathematical problems while dining, navigating
              the streets, or during other daily activities. Therefore, pursuing
              mathematics is a valuable endeavor. 
            </p>       
          </div>
        </div>


        




        <p>Only after you have made your best effort should you seek proof. This

          <a href="proofap.html" target="_blank">detailed proof</a>

          proof may not align with your conclusions. Another beautiful aspect of
          mathematics is that there are often multiple solutions to every problem,
          yet every path ultimately leads to the same outcome.
        </p>

        <p>Returning to the original problem, Ritesh needed a total of 1,770
          rupees. He began earning 1 rupee on the first day, and his earnings
          increased by 1 rupee each subsequent day. To determine how many days it
          would take for him to accumulate 1,770 rupees, we can use the formula
          for the sum of an arithmetic sequence. This will help us find the number
          of days needed to reach that total. Using 
          <a href="#eq:enumeration2">equation 2</a>
          we can write
        </p>

        <p><span class="math-inline">\[\frac{n(n+1)}{2}=1770\]</span></p>

        <p>This is a quadratic equation, which we will learn more about in this
          article in section titled 
          <a href="#Quadratic Equation">Quadratic Equation</a>
          . I recommend that anyone unfamiliar with solving quadratic
          equations read the relevant section. Solving the quadratic equation, the
          meaningful result we get is <span class="math-inline">\(n=59\)</span>,
          which is less than two months.
        </p>
        
        <p>Well, in another scenario, Mr. Kumar could also have said that he would double the amount every
          day, starting with giving 1 rupee on the first day. Then the progression
          would have looked something like this 
          <span class="math-inline">\[1,2,4,8,16,32,\cdots\]</span>
        </p>

        <p>This type of progression is known as geometric progression and
          closely resembles the process of deriving the formulas for the sum and
          the nth term of an arithmetic progression. Therefore, I will now
          transition to more complex and interesting progressions and sequences. I
          encourage readers to invest time in exploring geometric progression,
          attempting to formulate the relevant equations, and verifying them on
          their own. For those seeking a deeper understanding of 

          <a href="gp.html" target="_blank">Geometric progression</a>

          or who want to check their derived formulas, additional
          resources are available for further study.
        </p>

        <section id="hp"><h1>Harmonic Progression</h1>

        <p>I want to draw the reader’s attention to a more intricate concept. A
          Harmonic Progression is defined as a sequence in which the reciprocals
          of each term form an Arithmetic Progression. Or in mathematical terms, a
          general harmonic progression can be represented as follows. 
          <span class="math-inline">\[\frac{1}{a_1},\frac{1}{a_1+d},\frac{1}{a_1+2d},\frac{1}{a_1+3d},\cdots\]</span>
          As one can see, the reciprocals of each term constitute an Arithmetic
          Progression, where the first term is denoted as 
          <span class="math-inline">\(a_1\)</span> 
          and the common difference is represented by 
          <span class="math-inline">\(d\)</span>. 
          It must now be apparent that the general terms for the Harmonic progression is 
          
        </p>
        
        <span class="math-inline">
          <div id="eq:enumeration3">
            \[\begin{equation} \tag{3}
              a_n=\frac{1}{a_1+(n-1)d},
            \end{equation}\]
          </div>
        </span>

        <p>
          where 
          <span class="math-inline">\(\frac{1}{a_1}\)</span> 
          is the first term of the Harmonic Progression.
        </p>

        <p>In discussing harmonic progression, an intriguing aspect emerges when
          compared to arithmetic and geometric progressions. In the latter two
          cases, one can easily derive a formula for the sum of the first n terms.
          However, a general formula for computing the sum of n terms in a
          harmonic progression, given the first term and common difference, does
          not exist.
        </p>
        
       
        

        <div class="tcolorbox">
          <div class="tcolorbox-title">Important Note For The Readers</div>
          <div class="tcolorbox-body">
            <p>I have experienced numerous sleepless nights grappling with the
              realization that such a formula does not exist. I have dedicated
              extensive time and effort to this pursuit without achieving success. I
              encourage readers to engage in this exploration themselves, as one may
              uncover unexpected insights.
            </p>
            <p>As one of the most prominent pure mathematicians of the 21st century,
              Manjul Bhargava remarked, "Some of the most prominent formulas in
              mathematics are found just because one was looking for the most
              beautiful mathematics out there." This statement underscores the
              intrinsic beauty that can be discovered within mathematical inquiry.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Though there are some practical uses of harmonic progression. The most 
          famous one is the solution for block stacking problem. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The problem says -

            <div class="tcolorbox-title">The Block Stacking Problem</div>
            <div class="tcolorbox-body">
              <p>"Place N identical rigid rectangular blocks in a stable stack on a table edge in such a way as to maximize the overhang."</p>
            </div>
          </div>

        <p>
          Since this problem involves dealing with physical concepts like 
          gravitational forces, centre of mass, and torques. It is not a 
          mathematician's responsibility to do these; it's physicists.
        </p>

        <p>All I can do is this-

          article on Wikipedia, where you can explore the application of harmonic 
          progression in determining the general solution for this topic.
        </p>

        <p>In forthcoming sections, we will explore the underlying reasons for
          the absence of a summation formula in harmonic progression.
          Additionally, it is noteworthy that while geometric progression permits
          a general formula for any infinite geometric series, neither arithmetic nor harmonic
          progression offers a similar capability. 
        </p>
        <p>Before jumping on to
          discovering more series and sequences, i recommend readers who are not
          much familiar with the definition of series, sequences, converging and
          diverging series to read this short page on

          I want all the readers to atleast try to see the behavior and the properties of this series. 
          We will return back to this after a little discussion on some other series.

          In the standard, rigorous definition of convergence, the series discussed herein are all divergent. The values assigned to them are derived from alternative summation methods that extend the concept of a <i>sum</i> to series that do not converge in the traditional sense. The following sections present the common heuristic, or non-rigorous, arguments used to arrive at these famous results. These manipulations are not valid under the standard rules of algebra for infinite series but provide an intuitive path to the values obtained through more advanced methods.
        </p>

        <p>Though these series do not converge in the classical sense, using summation methods like Cesàro summation, Abel summation, or analytic continuation, we can assign finite values to them.

          For example, for the series
          <span class="math-inline">( S_2 \)</span>
          , we have:
          <span class="math-inline">\[
          1 - S_2 = S_2 \implies \boxed{S_2 = \frac{1}{2}}
          \]
        </span>
          

          Next, let \( S \) denote the sum of natural numbers:
          <span class="math-inline">
          \[
          S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \cdots
          \]
          </span>

          Adding \( S \) and \( S_5 \) term by term gives:
          <span class="math-inline">\[
          S + S_5 = (1+1) + (2-2) + (3+3) + (4-4) + \cdots = 2 + 0 + 6 + 0 + \cdots = 4 S
          \]</span>
          

          Rearranging, we find:
          <span class="math-inline">\[
          S + S_5 = 4 S \implies S_5 = 3 S
          \]</span>

          From analytic continuation, we assign:
          <span clas="math-inline">
          \[
          \boxed{S = -\frac{1}{12}}

          In this discussion, we will explore various sequences that manifest in nature and numerical patterns in unexpected ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's first start with the following question?
        </p>

        <h3>Question 7.1</h3>

        <p>Prove that if the 
          <span class="math-inline">\(n^\text{th}\)</span>

          Let’s check out a cool mathematical sequence that really shows off beauty in nature. 
          You can find this sequence in all sorts of places, like the twists of seashells and 
          the designs of flowers. It’s caught the attention of everyone from ancient Greek math 
          whizzes to groundbreaking scientists, innovative architects from the 20th century, 
          and even in a hit movie thriller.

        </p>
        <p>
          What’s amazing about this sequence is that it pops up everywhere. It’s not just a neat math thing; 
          It is found in the writings of an ancient Greek mathematician, the musings of a revolutionary 
          cosmological scientist, the designs of a twentieth-century architect, and the intrigue of a 
          best-selling thriller novel-turned-movie blockbuster. People love to debate its significance and how it can be used.

        </p>

        <p>
          Artists, architects, and many others get inspired by this idea, using it to make their work more beautiful 
          and appealing. Let’s dive into this fascinating world of math and see how it influences art, science, and nature!

        <h3>Fibonacci Sequence</h3>
        <p>
          This sequence is named after the famous Italian mathematician 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci" target="_blank">(Fibonacci)</a>
          . However, Leonardo Fibonacci did not discover the Fibonacci sequence. Although 
          he popularized it in Western Europe, the sequence was known to Indian mathematicians 
          centuries earlier. Fibonacci introduced it to the Western world in his 1202 book "Liber Abaci", 
          but it was studied in India as early as the 6th century BC by Pingala and later by Hemachandra.
        </p>

        <p>
          The sequence is described as follows.

        <p>The easiest derivation is by constructing a function as follows,</p>

          is the n-th term in the fibonacci sequence.

        <p>Since we know from

          that
          <span class="math-inline">\( a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n \text{ and } a_0 = 1 \text{ and } a_1 = 1\)</span>.
          Multiplying both sides by \(x^n\) and using a summation from zero to infinity, we get,

        <span class="math-inline">
          \[

            \[\begin{equation} \tag{17}

          <span class="math-inline">\(B\)</span>

          <a href="#eq:enumeration17">equation 17</a> 
          our assumed partial fraction form.
        </p>

        <p>
            Substituting

            and

            back into our assumed form for

        </p>

        <span class="math-inline">
            \[ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac{1}{x-\beta} - \frac{1}{x-\alpha}\right) \]
        </span>

        <p>
            To use the geometric series expansion, we rearrange the terms into the form \(\frac{C}{1-rx}\), noting that \(\frac{1}{\alpha} = \phi\) and \(\frac{1}{\beta} = 1 - \phi\), where \(\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\) is the golden ratio.
        </p>

        <span class="math-inline">
            \[ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left( \frac{1/\alpha}{1-x/\alpha} - \frac{1/\beta}{1-x/\beta} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac{\phi}{1 - \phi x} - \frac{1-\phi}{1 - (1-\phi)x}\right) \]
        </span>

        <p>
            Using the geometric series formula \(\frac{1}{1-y} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} y^n\), we can expand the fractions:
        </p>

        <span class="math-inline">
            \[ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \phi^{n+1} x^n - \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (1-\phi)^{n+1} x^n \right) \]
        </span>

        <p>
            By equating the coefficients of \(x^n\) with \(a_n\), we arrive at the closed-form expression for the sequence starting with \(a_0=1, a_1=1\):
        </p>

        <span class="math-inline">
                \[ a_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left[ \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n+1} - \left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n+1} \right] \]
        </span>


        <p>
            This formula allows you to calculate the \(n\)-th term of the sequence directly.

          The first interesting thing about the Fibonacci sequence is: 
          Almost every flower follow this pattern, as the number of

        <h3>Finding the value of golden ratio</h3>
        <p>
          In the sequence, it seems that there is no clear pattern, 
          except for what is indicated in 
          <a href="#eq:enumeration7">equation 7</a>. 
          However, mathematicians are inherently curious and 
          enjoy exploring mathematical concepts. 
          They continuously dig deeper until they find elegant 
          relationships and patterns. They have noticed that, as 
          we move further along in the series, the ratio of two 
          preceding terms approaches a fascinating value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's determine the value of 
          <span class="math-inline">\(\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\) </span>
          as n approaches infinity.{ In calculus, we commonly use the symbol 
          "lim" to address these types of problems. However, in this 
          instance, we will proceed without the concept of limits and 
          use a more intuitive approach to compute our value.}
        </p>
        <p>
          Using <a href="#eq:enumeration7">equation 7</a>, we can write:
        </p>

        <span class="math-inline">
          <div id="eq:enumeration15">
            \[
            \begin{equation}\tag{15}
              \frac{a_{n+2}}{a_{n+1}} = 1 + \frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}
            \end{equation}
            \]
          </div>

        </span>
        <p>
        And when <span class="math-inline">\( n \)</span> is large enough, we can write:
        </p>

        <span class="math-inline">
          <div id="eq:enumeration16">
            \[
            \begin{equation}\tag{16}
              r = 1 + \frac{1}{r}
            \end{equation}
            \]
          </div>
        </span>

        <p>
        Where <span class="math-inline">\( r \)</span> is the ratio of two preceding terms as <span class="math-inline">\( n \)</span> approaches infinity.
        </p>

        <p>This gives us a quadratic equation:</p>

        <span class="math-inline">
          <div id="eq:enumeration17">
            \[
            \begin{equation}\tag{17}
              r^2 - r - 1 = 0
            \end{equation}
            \]
          </div>
        </span>

        <p>Solving this quadratic equation yields:</p>

        <span class="math-inline">
          <div id="eq:enumeration18">
            \[
            \begin{equation}\tag{18}
              r = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
            \end{equation}
            \]
          </div>
        </span>
        

        <p>
        We give this irrational number a new symbol and name: the golden ratio, denoted by <span class="math-inline">\( \phi \)</span>. Approximating:
        </p>

        <span class="math-inline">
          \[
          \begin{equation}\tag{19}
            \phi = 1.61803398875\cdots
          \end{equation}
          \]
        </span>
          
        

        <p>Let’s see if this is correct:<p>

        <span class="math-inline">
          \[
          \begin{align*}
            \frac{2}{1}   &= 2 \\
            \frac{3}{2}   &= 1.5 \\
            \frac{5}{3}   &= 1.666\cdots \\
            \frac{8}{5}   &= 1.6\cdots \\
            \frac{13}{8}  &= 1.625 \\
            \frac{21}{13} &= 1.615\cdots \\
            \frac{34}{21} &= 1.619\cdots \\
            \frac{55}{34} &= 1.617
          \end{align*}
          \]
        </span>

        <p>
        And so on. As we progress further, we get closer to the value of 
        <span class="math-inline">\( \phi \)</span>. 
        It takes the ratio of the 11th and 10th terms to achieve the third digit correct after the decimal of 
        <span class="math-inline">\( \phi \)</span>
        , which is 
        <span class="math-inline">\( \frac{88}{55} = 1.61818\cdots \)</span>.
        Additionally, it takes the ratio of the 20th and 19th terms to achieve 10 
        correct digits of 
        <span class="math-inline">\( \phi \)</span> 
        after the decimal point.
        </p>

        <p>The golden ratio is used in every field and if you are wondering why this page is looking beautiful in terms of dimensions? The answer 
          is because i have used the golden ratio throughout the designing this website.

          developed Pascal's triangle, which is useful in many cases; 
          however, we will discuss only one application here. 
          It is also worthwhile to know the 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle#History" target="_blank">history</a>
          of this triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pascal's triangle looks something like this.
        </p>

        <div class="pascal-container" id="triangle"></div>

        <p>
          The rule is simple: 
          for each row, start with 1, 
          then add the two terms just above 
          it from the preceding row, and end with 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blaise Pascal was clever enough to notice that this triangle follows the very same pattern as the 
          coefficients of the expansion of 
          <span class="math-inline">\((x+y)^n\)</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>Let's see the pattern ourself.</p>

        <span class="math-inline">
          \[
          \begin{align*}
            (x+y)^0 &= 1 \\
            (x+y)^1 &= x+y \\
            (x+y)^2 &= x^2+2xy+y^2 \\
            (x+y)^3 &= x^3+3x^2y+3xy^2+y^3 \\
            (x+y)^4 &= x^4+4x^3y+6x^2y^2+4xy^3+y^4 \\
            (x+y)^5 &= x^5+5x^4y+10x^3y^2+10x^2y^3+5xy^4+y^5 \\
            (x+y)^6 &= x^6+6x^5y+15x^4y^2+20x^3y^3+15x^2y^4+6xy^5+y^6 \\
            (x+y)^7 &= x^7+7x^6y+21x^5y^2+35x^4y^3+35x^3y^4+21x^2y^5+7xy^6+y^7 \\
            (x+y)^8 &= x^8+8x^7y+28x^6y^2+56x^5y^3+70x^4y^4+56x^3y^5+28x^2y^6+8xy^7+y^8 \\
            (x+y)^9 &= x^9+9x^8y+36x^7y^2+84x^6y^3+126x^5y^4+126x^4y^5+84x^3y^6+36x^2y^7+9xy^8+y^9 
          \end{align*}
          \]
        </span>
        <P>As one can see that the coefficient of expansion of 
          <span class="math-inline">\((x+y)^n\)</span>
          resembles the nth row of the Pascal's triangle.
        </P>
        <p>
          There's two nice way to formulate the binomial expansion. 
          One is given here and the other is talked in the calculus section.
        </p>
        <p>
          We define a function for the rth column and nth row of the pascals triangle as 
          <span class="math-inline">\(F(r,n)\)</span>.
          This funtion also tells the rth term coefficient in the expansion of 
          <span class="math-inline">\((x+y)^n\)</span>.
          By observing the pascals triangle, one can easily write the following:
        </p>
        <span class="math-inline">
          <div id="eq:enumeration20">
            \[
            \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
            F(r,n+1) &= F(r-1,n) + F(r,n) \\
            \text{and for every } n,\quad F(0,n) &= 1,\quad F(n,n) = 1
            \end{aligned}
            \tag{20}
            \end{equation}
            \]
          </div>
        </span>
        <p>Why we can write this. Because thats basically how we define 
          the rule for writing out the pascal's triangle( see the rule above).
        </p>
        <p>
          Again i would definitely encourage the reader to try and work out 
          a well defined function that behaves and satisfies all the conditions in
          <a href="#eq:enumeration20">equation 20</a>. 
          
          But everyone familiar with the notation of 
          <span class="math-inline">\(\binom{n}{r}\)</span>
          or sometimes also written as
          <span class="math-inline">\({}^{n}C_{r}\)</span>,
          might know this is one that satisfies the above requirement in 
          <a href="#eq:enumeration19">equation 19</a>. And is defined as
        </p>
        <span class="math-inline">
          <div id="eq:enumeration21">
            \[
            \begin{equation}\tag{21}
              \binom{n}{r}={}^{n}C_{r}=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}
            \end{equation}
            \]
          </div>
        </span>
        <p>
          The following property about the 
          <span class="math-inline">\(\binom{n}{r}\)</span>
          can be confirmed by the readers:
        </p>
        <span class="math-inline">
          <div id="eq:enumeration22">
            \[
            \begin{equation}\tag{22}
              \binom{n+1}{r}=\binom{n}{r-1}+\binom{n}{r}
            \end{equation}
            \]
          </div>
        </span>
        <p>
          As it can be seen that the 
          <a href="#eq:enumeration22">equation 22</a>
          satisfies the property or condition in 
          <a href="#eq:enumeration20">equation 20</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus using the above equations and pascal's triangle, one can write the 
          general expansion of 
          <span class="math-inline">\((x+y)^n\)</span>.

        <section id="Quadratic Equation">
        <h1>Quadratic Equation</h1>

        <p>Now we are going to discuss quadratic equations. 
          As seen in the article until now, it is that one 
          concept that can pop up while dealing with other 
          concepts as well.
        </p>
        <p>So a quadratic equation is just a special 
          kind of polynomial (to know more about 
          polynomials, go to the function section) 
          with degree 2. Or in simpler words, any 
          equation that can be written in the 
          following form is a quadratic equation.
        </p>
        <span class="math-inline">
          <div id="eq:enumeration24">
            \[
            \begin{equation}\tag{24}
              y=ax^2+bx+c
            \end{equation}
            \]
          </div>
        </span>
        <p>This equation must have seemed quite similar to most of the 
          readers, as anyone who has passed the eighth standard all around 
          the world knows this equation and also the solution of the roots 
          of this equation. By roots of the equation, we mean to find such 
          values of x that make the value of the equation zero, that is, y = 0.
        </p>
        <p>The equation in 
          <a href="#eq:enumeration24">equation (24)</a> 
          can also be written in terms of its roots.

        <p>Let

          be one of the roots of the 
          <a href="#eq:enumeration24">equation (24)</a>
          . Thus, 
          dividing the 
          <a href="#eq:enumeration24">equation (24)</a>
          by
          <span class="math-inline">\(x-\alpha\) </span> 
          gives us the

        <h3>Playing with the quadratic equation </h3>

        </p>
        <p>So we know that,</p>

            a\alpha^2+b\alpha+c &= 0 \quad

          \end{align*}
          \]
        </span>
        <p>Now we are gonna do some simple algebra that ought to be 
          understood by the readers.

          (I encourage readers to find a derivation and not 
          a general proof, though it might work as well to checck if the identity is correct or not. But i want the readers to go through the

        <h3>Quadratic Graphs in Different Cases:</h3>

        <p>We are now going to see how the quadratic functions behave on the real plane.
          We write a quadratic function as follows,
        </p>

        <span class="math-inline">
          <div id="eq:enumeration31">
            \[
            \begin{equation}\tag{31}
                  f(x)= ax^2+bx+c
            \end{equation}
            \]
          </div>
        </span>
        <p>Now if you notice in 
          <a href="#eq:enumeration30">equation (30)</a>
          the roots of the equation depends on all the coefficients. 
          But if u notice there's a term 
          <span class="math-inline">\(\sqrt{b^2-4ac}\) </span>.
          This can be considered as the most powerful term in the formula 
          if we put it that way, not only because of the fact that it is the 
          term that decides if the equation will have a real root or not, but also 
          because it is contains all the terms of the equation. So if we change even a 
          single coefficient, the behaviour and the roots changes.
        </p>
        <p>So we will start of by letting, 
          <span class="math-inline">\((b^2-4ac)=D\) </span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very easy to check that when,
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Case 1:</strong> D>0, we get two distinct real roots.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Case 2:</strong> D<0, we can't get two distinct real roots, instead we get two distinct complex roots.

          (for those without the knowlege of imaginary numbers, i suggest you to read a little bit of the complex analysis section.)
        </p>
        <p>
